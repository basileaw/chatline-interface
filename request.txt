I need your help implementing a loading animation for the first response in chatline when no preface text is provided.

When a chatline Interface is instantiated without preface text, there's a significant blank screen period while waiting for the first streamed response chunk. This creates an awkward user experience where nothing is visible in the terminal during what can be a long initial wait time.

I would like to implement a loading animation that simulates a "fake stream" of a string word by word, like fake_forward_stream_text(),  along with a dot loading animation. Essentially, I am very happy with the rweind animations (fake streaming text, dot loading animation) and it's integration with other animations, like _process_message() , and i want the ability to start a conversation like that. Unfortunately, Chatline is poorly designed/ maintained, so even implementing a simple feature like this cleanly is really challenging.

## API Requirements
- Add loading_message parameter to Interface constructor
- Only show loading animation when no preface is provided
- Maintain full backward compatibility

## Critical Requirements
- The loading message must participate in terminal buffer calculations and screen height logic
- The loading message should NOT be added to conversation history/state
- The transition from loading to real response must be seamless
- Preserve all existing behavior when preface text IS provided
- Maintain proper spacing: loading message, empty line, then real response

## Key Integration Points
- Logic should be added to introduce_conversation() in /chatline/conversation/actions.py
- Leverage fake_forward_stream_text() from reverse_streamer.py (proven to work with any text length)
- Use existing _process_message() flow with dot_loader for continuous animation
- Ensure retry functionality works without duplication

## Expected Behavior

When `Interface(loading_message="Initializing AI assistant...")` is used with no preface:

1. Screen shows nothing initially
2. Loading message streams in word by word: "> Initializing", "> Initializing AI", "> Initializing AI assistant..."
3. Dots start animating after the loading message: "> Initializing AI assistant.", "> Initializing AI assistant..", "> Initializing AI assistant..."
4. When first response chunk arrives, dots stop and response streams in two lines below
5. Final display shows: "> Initializing AI assistant...\n\n[assistant response]"
6. Loading message persists in conversation display but is NOT in conversation history
7. Retry/edit/rewind functionality works correctly

The goal is to create the same professional, movie-like experience as the rewind animation but for initial loading.

I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I feel like there must be a way to recreate some of the animations that are working perfectly in other contexts in this new context cleanly. 

What do you think is the best way to go about this?
